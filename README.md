Description: This program is a simple MAUI blazor hybrid app that can be used to run a basic tournament. This provides organizers with a web-friendly GUI for navigating a tournament. The app is broken up into three sections: Tournament, Matches, and Standings. 

The first section handles creating and managing a tournament. This includes, registering player as well as saving or loading a tournament. 

The second page handles rounds and matches. Once a tournament has been populated by players, an organizer can easily generate a new round where players will be paired against one-another using a simple swiss-pairing algorithm. Results can then be individually input for each match using simple buttons.

The final page displays the standings of all players in the tournament based on the records of their wins, losses, and draws. The app automatically calculates position and score for the organizer. An organizer can then print the standings to a simple text file for their records after the tournament.
